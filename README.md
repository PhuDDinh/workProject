# workProject
First work project, data is CSV.
Goal is to find the past dates and the # attached to the past dates and update the dates.

## Path Forward
For now, we can work off the same branch.  As the project takes shape, we'll enforce the following:
  - 'main' branch can only accept Pull Requests
  - Pull Requests must can only be merged in after being code reviewed

Begin with everything in root directory and in one file.  As the project grows, we can start creating project directory structure as needed and split out logic into different source files.

Remember to write unit test to make sure your functions are doing what they're supposed to.
