# workProject
First work project, data is CSV.
Goal is to find the past dates and the # attached to the past dates and update the dates.

## Path Forward
Begin with everything in root directory and in one file.  As the project grows, we can start creating project directory structure as needed and split out logic into different source files.

Remember to write unit test to make sure your functions are doing what they're supposed to.
